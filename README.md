This project focused on the processing and analysis of EEG signals to predict epileptic seizures using machine learning techniques. The methodology was inspired by the research article "Epileptic Seizure Prediction Using Spectral Entropy-Based Features of EEG."
1. Data Preprocessing: I was provided with a dataset of EEG recordings from multiple patients. In the initial phase, I performed signal preprocessing to remove baseline drift, noise, and other artifacts. This step was crucial to enhance the quality of the signals for accurate feature extraction and classification.
2. Feature Extraction and Model Training: Leveraging MATLAB’s machine learning toolbox, I extracted relevant features from the preprocessed signals—particularly focusing on spectral entropy, as outlined in the reference study. The data was then labeled and segmented to train classification models.
3. Seizure Prediction: I applied supervised learning algorithms to detect patterns in the EEG signals associated with epileptic seizures. The system was designed to predict the onset of seizures with the goal of improving patient safety and real-time monitoring capabilities.
